Refund & Safety Policy
1. Is InstantPay Safe?

Yes, InstantPay is designed to be a secure and reliable digital payments platform. User safety and transaction integrity are core priorities of the company. InstantPay follows industry-standard security practices to protect user data and ensure that payments are processed safely through authorized banking channels.

Key safety measures include:

Secure UPI authentication through user-approved bank processes

Encryption of sensitive transaction-related information

Real-time transaction status updates for transparency

Monitoring systems to identify unusual or suspicious activity

InstantPay does not store users’ banking credentials and works in coordination with partner banks to maintain a secure payment environment.

2. Refund Process and Time Taken to Initiate Refunds

Refunds on InstantPay are typically initiated when a transaction fails, is reversed by the bank, or is identified as unsuccessful.

Refund process:

Failed or reversed transactions are automatically identified by the system

Once confirmed, the refund is initiated to the original payment source

Users are notified about the refund initiation status within the app

Refund timelines:

Most refunds are initiated within 24 hours of transaction failure

The refunded amount is usually credited within 2–5 working days

In rare cases involving bank-side delays, refunds may take up to 7 working days

Users are not required to manually request refunds for standard failed transactions.

3. No False or Unauthorized Refunds

InstantPay follows strict verification processes to ensure that false, duplicate, or unauthorized refunds are not possible.

Refunds are initiated only after system or bank confirmation

Each refund is linked to a unique transaction reference ID

Manual refunds are processed only after proper validation

These measures help maintain fairness, prevent misuse, and protect both users and merchants from incorrect refund claims.

4. Reporting Fraudulent Transactions or Payments Made by Mistake

If a user identifies a fraudulent transaction or has made a payment by mistake, they should report the issue immediately through InstantPay’s support channels.

Once reported:

Users are guided through the next steps based on the outcome of the review

Early reporting increases the chances of timely resolution.
